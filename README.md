# River Non River image classification using Logistic Regression

• Four satellite Images of Hoogly River, Kolkata (Rband, Gband, Bband and Iband) are given to you with equal image size (512 * 512).

• The feature vector dimension is 4

• Each pixel location we have four values.

• Two Classes are given (River and NonRiver)

• Take 50 sample points (Pixel location’s corresponding pixel values) from river class for training for each band

• Take 100 sample points (Pixel location’s corresponding pixel values) from non river class for training for each band.

• Take (512 * 512) sample points (Pixel location’s corresponding pixel values) for testing for each band.

• Apply logistic regression to classify all the test sample either in river or nonriver class denoting 0 and 255 at corresponding pixel locations.

• Show the result in image form with black and white image (either 0 and 255)
